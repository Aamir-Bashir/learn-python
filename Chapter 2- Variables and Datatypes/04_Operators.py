#Arthmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b  # Addition
difference = a - b  # Subtraction
product = a * b  # Multiplication
quotient = a / b  # Division
remainder = a % b  # Modulus
exponent = a ** b  # Exponentiation
print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
print("Remainder:", remainder)
print("Exponent:", exponent)

# Assignment Operators
a = 10-5 # Assigning the value of 10 - 5 to a
b = 5
# b += 2  # Increment b by 2 (b = b + 2)
# b -= 1  # Decrement b by 1 (b = b - 1)
# b *= 3  # Multiply b by 3 (b = b * 3)
b /= 2  # Divide b by 2 (b = b / 2)
print("Updated value of b:", b)

#Comparison Operators
a = 10
b = 5
print("Is a equal to b?", a == b)  # Equal to
print("Is a not equal to b?", a != b)  # Not equal to
print("Is a greater than b?", a > b)  # Greater than
print("Is a less than b?", a < b)  # Less than
print("Is a greater than or equal to b?", a >= b)  # Greater than or equal to
print("Is a less than or equal to b?", a <= b)  # Less than or equal to

# Logical Operators
#TRUTH TABLE
print("True and False is: ", True and False )  # Logical AND
print("True or False is: ", True or False )  # Logical OR
print("Not True is: ", not True )  # Logical NOT
